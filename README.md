<p>This is a wordpress theme created specificly for a bycycle club in Kalmar</p>

<h3>Developing</h3>
<p>The theme is created by me, Alexander Midjich. For developing the theme I have worked with plain html, css and some javascript. I have used a clean wordpress theme from http://underscores.me, just to get the necessay files for a wordpress theme to work.</p>

<p>Plug-ins that I have used for this theme is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced custom fields</li>
  <li>Custom post types</li>
  <li>WpForms</li>
  
<h3>compatibility</h3>
<p>This theme works on desktop, mobiles and tablets. For desktop I have tested it on chrome, firefox, IE, Edge and Safari</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>
The club didn't have any specific they wanted me to regard in making their new site accept for some kind of a calender function. What I have done is that I choose to display some general information that they can update as they see fit. As for the calender I had a look on some of the plug-ins in wordpress put then decided on google calender, simply because I believe it to be one of the more user friendly calender and you can invite anyone you want to see and upload new events.</p>

<p>What the user will be able to do with this theme is that they can change all the text fields, all the images and the menu. Besides that they also have the features from google calender.</p>

<p>A live version of the site is currently up and running on http://www.kalmarck.midjich.se</p>
