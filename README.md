<p>This is a wordpress theme created specificly for a bycycle club here in Kalmar</p>

<p>The theme is created by me, Alexander Midjich. For developing the theme I have worked with plain html, css and some javascript. I have used a clean wordpress theme from http://underscores.me, just to get the necessay files for a wordpress theme to work.  The club didn't have any specific they wanted me to regard in making their new site accept for some kind of a calender function. What I have done is that I basicly adjusted the theme to display some general information that they can update as they see fit. As for the calender I had a look on some of the plug-ins in wordpress put then decided on google calender, simply because I believe it to be most user friendly and you can invite anyone you want to see and upload new events.</p>

<p>What the user will be able to do with this theme is that they can change all the text fields, all the images and the menu. Besides that they also have the features from google calender.</p>

<p>A live version of the site is currently up and running on <a href="http://www.kalmarck.midjich.se>kalmarck.midjich.se"</a></p>
